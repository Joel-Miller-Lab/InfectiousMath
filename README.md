# InfectiousMath
This repository is intended to provide a set of self-contained examples, much like the [Mudd math fun facts](https://math.hmc.edu/funfacts/) which demonstrate mathematics through infectious disease examples.

I may extend it to include statistical issues as well, but I would rely on others for the expertise.
